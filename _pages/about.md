Hi, I am a researcher and engineer based in Cape Town, South Africa. With a Master of Science (Engineering) and a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Computer) from the University of Cape Town, I have built a strong foundation in electrical engineering principles and practices.

My research interests are diverse and encompass cutting-edge fields such as computer vision, machine learning, optics, microscopy, fluid stream analysis, automotive electronics, and PCB design. This wide range of interests allows me to approach problems from multiple angles, fostering innovative solutions.

In the laboratory, I thrive on designing and executing experiments that push the boundaries of our technology. However, I am equally enthusiastic about field testing and deploying solutions in real-world environments. This hands-on experience is necessary for validating research findings and ensuring that theoretical advancements translate into practical, impactful applications.

By combining rigorous academic research with practical implementation, I strive to contribute to technological advancements that benefit society.
