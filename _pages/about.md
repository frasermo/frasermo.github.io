Hi, I am an engineer and researcher based in Cape Town, South Africa. I have built a strong foundation in electrical engineering principles and practices with an MSc (Electrical Engineering) and a BSc Eng (Electrical and Computer) from the University of Cape Town. My expertise spans computer vision, machine learning, optics, microscopy, fluid stream analysis, automotive electronics, and PCB design.

I specialise in developing engineering solutions, designing and executing experimental research, and integrating field testing to ensure real-world applicability. I drive innovation and contribute to technological progress by bridging theoretical advancements with practical implementation.
