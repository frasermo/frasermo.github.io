Hi, I am a research student at the University of Cape Town's Digital Image Processing Laboratory, housed within the Department of Electrical Engineering. With a Master of Science (Engineering) and a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Computer) from the University of Cape Town, I have built a strong foundation in electrical engineering principles and practices.

My research interests are diverse and encompass cutting-edge fields such as computer vision, machine learning, optics, microscopy, fluid stream analysis, PCB design, and electronics. This wide range of interests allows me to approach problems from multiple angles, fostering innovative solutions.

In the laboratory, I thrive on designing and executing experiments that push the boundaries of our technology. However, my passion doesn't stop at the lab door. I am equally enthusiastic about field testing and deploying solutions in real-world environments. This hands-on experience is necessary for validating research findings and ensuring that theoretical advancements translate into practical, impactful applications.

By combining rigorous academic research with practical implementation, I strive to contribute to advancements in technology that have tangible benefits for society.
