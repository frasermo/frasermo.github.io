Hi, I am an engineer and researcher based in Cape Town, South Africa, with an MSc (Electrical Engineering) and a BSc Eng (Electrical and Computer) from the University of Cape Town. My work focuses on computer vision, machine learning, optics, microscopy, spectral fluid stream sensing, automotive electronics, and PCB design.

I specialise in developing engineering solutions, conducting experimental research, and integrating field testing to ensure real-world applicability. My approach bridges theoretical insight with practical implementation to support innovation and advance technological progress.
